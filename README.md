# MAX heapsort
Max heapsort in Python. Input is unsorted array -> output is sorted array.

Heapsort is written recursively to sink parents and bubble up largest values to position 0. 
After this is complete the program pops the max value and appends it to newly created array.

Runtime complexity:
  O(n log(n))
